Howto
  1. Add a reference to the Simple Droid RPC library
  2. Create the classes you want to export
  3. Write the interface descriptions
  4. Compile it and add the generated files to your Android project

  To start a server instance instantiate the RPCServerInstance class.
  
  To call a remote procedure instantiate the corresponding "Remote class" (for a
  given class named "Example", instantiate the generated RemoteExample). Then
  use it as if it was local.


Interface description example
  {
    interface Operations {
      method add (int a, int b) returns (int)
      method sub (int a, int b) returns (int) async
    }

    interface Echo {
      method getEcho () returns (String)
    }
  }

An async method use a callback to handle the result while a non a sync method
wait for the response.


Server example
  In the onCreate method of the main activity :
  new RPCServerInstance (4000);


Remote method call example
  RemoteOperation remote = new RemoteOperation ("192.168.42.42", 4000);
  try {
    int res = remote.add (2, 3);
  } catch (Exception e) {
    ...
  }

Remote async method call example
  RemoteOperation remote = new RemoteOperation ("192.168.42.42", 4000);
  remote.sub (2, 3, new InvocationListener<Integer> () {
    @Override
    public void onComplete(Integer result) {
      ...
    }

    @Override
    public void onException(Exception e) {
      ...
    }
  });
